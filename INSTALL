Obtaining the software
======================

RNGzip is available in several forms: a platform-neutral binary
(.jar), a source bundle (.tar.gz), and from a Darcs repository.  All
of these can be found at

> <http://contrapunctus.net/dist/rngzip/>


Platform-neutral binary
-----------------------

The simplest way to get started with RNGzip is to download
`rngzip-VERSION.jar` from the URL above.  This contains all the class
files needed to run the program, so all you need to do to run it is:

    % java -jar rngzip-VERSION.jar

You may want to set up a shell script or batch file to do this.


Source bundle
-------------

The sources to the program are available in files named like
`rngzip-VERSION.tar.gz`.  Download and unpack this file.  To build
RNGzip, you need `javac`, at least version 1.5.0.  The following
makefile targets are available:

  * `make default` — compiles the entire program into a `build/`
    sub-directory.

  * `make jar` — also creates the file `rngzip-VERSION.jar`.

  * `make api-docs` — builds the API documentation in `doc/api/`; this
    is of interest to developers only and is not provided by default.

  * `make all-api-docs` — also include the libraries in the API
    documentation, for the sake of completeness.

  * `make test` — run the unit tests; requires that you have run
    `make` to build the program already, and it also requires some
    special tools — such as `trang` — to be in your path.


Darcs repository
----------------

This is useful if you want to fetch the latest (unstable!) development
sources or to contribute patches to RNGzip.  To clone the entire
repository, issue the command:

    % darcs get http://contrapunctus.net/dist/rngzip/trunk rngzip

You can save space and download time by using the `--partial` flag and
select particular tagged releases with `--tag`.  See the documentation
of [darcs](http://abridgegame.org/darcs/) for details.
