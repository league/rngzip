<H1>Compression via Arithmetic Coding in Java. Version 1.1</H1>

<H3>Changes in Version 1.1</H3>
<P>
Exclusion statistics for more accurate estimation.
<P>
Many source code optimizations, primarily at a fairly low level of detail.

<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>
This directory contains the distribution for a package to do compression
via arithmetic coding in Java.  A very brief description of arithmetic coding with lots of pointers to other material can be found in:
<UL>
<LI><a href="javadoc/tutorial.html">The Arithmetic Coding Tutorial</a>
</UL>
<P>
The arithmetic coding package contains a generic arithemtic coder and
decoder, along with byte stream models that are subclasses of Java's
I/O streams. Example statistical models include a uniform
distribution, simple unigram model, and a parametric prediction by
partial matching (PPM) model. Other models can be built in the
framework in the same way as the examples.  A prebuilt set of javadoc is available online:
<UL>
<LI><a href="javadoc/index.html">Javadoc for com.colloquial.arithcode</a>
</UL>

<H2>Quick Start for Java Pros</H2>
<P>
Download the <a href="colloquial_arithcode_src-1_1.jar">source</a> to target directory,
cd there, unjar the source, run <code>ant test</code>.


<H2>Downloading com.colloquial.arithcode</H2>
<P>
The distribution comes in three parts:

<UL>
  <LI><a href="colloquial_arithcode_src-1_1.jar">Source Distribution jar</a>
  <LI><a href="colloquial_arithcode_doc-1_1.jar">Javadoc jar</a>
  <LI><a href="colloquial_arithcode-1_1.jar">Precompiled Class Files jar</a>
</UL>


<H2>Using com.colloquial.arithcode</H2>
<P>
The precompiled class files may be used directly from jar by putting
the filename of the jar in the <code>CLASSPATH</code>, either in the
environment or in the argument to the JVM.
<P>
I attempted to structure the package according to the recommendations
in Sun's
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingapispecs/index.html">Requirements for Writing Java API Specifications</a>
and in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201310058/"><i>Effective Java</i></a> by Joshua Block.


<H2>Unpacking the documentation</H2>
<P>
The documentation may be unpacked into a directory by executing
the following sequence of commands, where <code>$TARGET_DIR</code> is the
target directory into which the documentation is to be unpacked.
<UL>
<LI><code>mv colloquial_arithcode_doc-1_1.jar $TARGET_DIR</code>
<LI><code>cd $TARGET_DIR</code>
<LI><code>jar xvf colloquial_arithcode_doc-1_1.jar</code>
</UL>
The documentation was intended to follow the recommendations
laid out in Sun's
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html">How to Write Doc Comments</a>.
I also used Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/doccheck/">Doc Check Utilities</a>
for checking completeness of doc and linking errors.  But they
only work with the 1.2 and 1.3 Java 2 SDKs.


<H2>Building from the source</H2>

<P>
The source may be unpacked in exactly the same way as the
documentation:
<UL>
<LI><code>mv colloquial_arithcode_src-1_1.jar $TARGET_DIR</code>
<LI><code>cd $TARGET_DIR</code>
<LI><code>jar xvf colloquial_arithcode_src-1_1.jar</code>
</UL>

<P>
The source has been tested with the 1.3 and 1.4 Java 2 SDK compilers.
The code may be compiled directly.  It is packaged in the appropriate
directory structure.  But I prefer to use <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Apache Ant</a>; it's like
makefiles, only in XML and comprehensible (I know that sounds like an
oxymoron several times over.). Ant can be downloaded as part of the <a
href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java
Web Services Developer Pack</a>.  I followed the directory structure
suggested by the useful but strangely named article <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ant_in_anger.html">Using Ant in
Anger</a>.

<P>
After unpacking the jar file and installing ant, the package and
documentation may be built from the command line and tests may be run.
For ant builds, there is a file conventionally named <code>build.xml</code> which
contains the build instructions. Here is the command to test that
everything's working, where <code>$TARGET_DIR</code> is where the
source was unpacked.:

<UL>
<LI><code>cd $TARGET_DIR</code>
<LI><code>ant test</code>
</UL>
There are no environment variable dependencies in the build.xml.  Use
<code>ant -projecthelp</code> to examine the other targets, or
look at the source.

<H2>Tools for Performance Tuning</H2>
<P>
I ran everything first through
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/tooldocs/windows/java.html"><code>java -Xprof</code></a>,
which is just the Sun Java runtime with profiling for Windows.  It actually
caught all the glaring inefficiencies, but to double-check, I ran it through
<a href="http://www.rational.com/products/quantify_nt/index.jsp">Rational Quantify for Windows</a>.
Quantify is great; I use it at work.  Get it if you can afford it.
It's worth it if you need the speed.  The implementations used here don't have
any glaring inefficiencies; the algorithms on the other hand ...  Any suggestions
for improvements or if you want to point out a glaring efficiency, I'd be glad to
hear about it.

<H3>Performance Note</H3>
<P>
For best performance, run <code>java</code> with the <code>-server</code> option.  You can find a lot of information in the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/docs/whitepaper/Java_Hotspot_v1.4.1/Java_HSpot_WP_v1.4.1_1002_1.html">Java Hotspot White Paper</a>, 
which contains a description of the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/products/hotspot/docs/whitepaper/Java_Hotspot_v1.4.1/Java_HSpot_WP_v1.4.1_1002_4.html#server">
Java HotSpot Server Compiler</a>.
The server option provides a lot of optimizations 
compiler provides extensive in-lining of one-line functions and other
code unfolding and folding based on runtime analysis of hotspots.  The
compressors and decompressors run around 10-50% faster in this mode.  For more discussion
of this compiler and tuning Java in general, see
