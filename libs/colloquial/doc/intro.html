Arithmetic coding is a general technique for coding the outcome of a
stochastic process based on an adaptive model.  The expected bit rate
is the cross-entropy rate of the model versus the actual process.

The arithmetic coder and decoder were ported to Java from the very clean
and well documented C code described in:

data compression. <i>Communications of the ACM</i> <b>30</b>(6): 520-540.
