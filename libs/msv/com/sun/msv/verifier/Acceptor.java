/**
 * exposes the low-level validation engine interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * represents a pseudo-automaton acceptor.
 * this interface is used to validate content models.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Perform Validation</h2>
 * <p>
 * To perform validation, call the createAcceptor method of the DocumentDeclaration
 * interface to obtain an Acceptor for validating the document element.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Acceptor a = vgm.createAcceptor();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One acceptor is responsible for validating one element. So you also need
 * some form of stack. If you are using a "push" interface like SAX, you need
 * an explicit stack. If you are validating in "pull" fashion (like DOM), then
 * you can use a recursion instead of an explicit stack.
 * The following explanation assumes SAX-like interface.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Now, get back to the story. Whenever you encounter a start tag, create a new
 * acceptor, which validates the children of newly encountered element.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * stack.push(a);
 * a = a.createChildAcceptor( sti, null );
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If this tag name was unexpected, then this method returns null. See javadoc
 * for more details.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Then, for every attributes, call the {@link #onAttribute} method.
 * After that you call the {@link #onEndAttributes} method.
 * 
 * <pre><xmp>
 * for( int i=0; i<atts.getLength(); i++ )
 *   a.onAttribute( atts.getURI(i), .... );
 * a.onEndAttributes();
 * </xmp></pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An error can occur at any method. See the method documentations for details.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you find an end tag, make sure that the acceptor is satisfied. An acceptor
 * is said to be unsatisfied when it needs more elements/text to complete the content
 * model. For example, if the content model is (A,B,C) and it only sees (A,B), then
 * the acceptor is not satisfied because it needs to see C.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * if(!a.isAcceptState(null))
 *   ; // error because the acceptor is unsatisfied.
 * Acceptor child = a;
 * a = stack.pop();
 * a.stepForward(child,null);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Then, call the stepForward method of the parent acceptor and pass
 * the child acceptor to it.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, whenever you see a text, call the onText method.
 * If the text was unexpected or not allowed, then this method returns null.
 * See the documentation for details.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * a.onText("text",context,null,null);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * In this way, you can better control the validation process.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you need even finer control of the validation process
 * (e.g., you need to know the list of allowed elements/attributes),
 * you may want to rely on the <code>regexp</code> implementation of VGM.
 * see {@link com.sun.msv.verifier.regexp.REDocumentDeclaration} for detail.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Downcasting</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is often useful to downcast the Acceptor interface to appropriate
 * derived class. For example, if you are using
 * {@link com.sun.msv.verifier.regexp.REDocumentDeclaration}, then you can always
 * downcast an Acceptor to
 * {@link com.sun.msv.verifier.regexp.ExpressionAcceptor}, which provides
 * more predictable behaviors and some useful methods.
 *
