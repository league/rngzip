/**
 * this class is used to parse foreign datatype vocabulary.
 * 
 * Each datatype vocabulary must be associated with one namespace URI.
 * When the element with that namespace URI is first found, this object is
 * instanciated. After that, whenever the element with the namespace URI
 * is found, createTopLevelReaderState method will be used to parse the element
 * (and its descendants.)
 * 
 * And whenever a reference to this vocabulary by name (e.g., "mydt:mytypename")
 * is found, getType method is called to resolve this name into DataType object.
 * 
 * One instance of this class is used throughout the parsing of one grammar.
 * Therefore, implementations are encouraged to take advantages of this property
 * and keep context information (e.g., user-defined named datatypes).
