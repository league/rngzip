/**
 * base interface of 'parsing state'.
 * 
 * parsing of XML representation of a grammar is done by
 * using various states.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each State-derived class is responsible for a particular type of
 * declaration of the grammar. For example, SequenceState is responsible
 * for parsing &lt;sequence&gt; element of RELAX module.
 * 
 * <p>
 * State objects interact each other. There are two ways of interaction.
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li>from parent to child
 *  <li>from child to parent
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The first type of communication occurs only when a child state object is
 * created. The last type of communication occurs usually (but not limited to)
 * when a child state sees its end tag.
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * In this level of inheritance, contract is somewhat abstract.
 * 
 * <ol>
 *  <li>When a State object is created, its init method is called
 *		and various information is set. Particularly, start tag
 *		information (if any) and the parent state is set.
 *		This process should only be initiated by GrammarReader.
 * 
 *  <li>After that, startSelf method is called. Usually,
 *		this is the place to do something useful.
 * 
 *  <li>State object is registered as a ContentHandler, and
 *		therefore will receive SAX events from now on.
 * 
 *  <li>Derived classes are expected to do something useful
 *		by receiving SAX events.
 * 
 *  <li>When a State object finishes its own part, it should
 *		call GrammarReader.popState method. It will remove
 *		the current State object and registers the parent state 
 *		as a ContentHandler again.
 * </ol>
 * 
 * Of course some derived classes introduce more restricted
 * contract. See {@link SimpleState}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * this class also provides:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>access to the parent state
 *  <li>default implementations for all ContentHandler callbacks
 *		except startElement and endElement
 * </ul>
