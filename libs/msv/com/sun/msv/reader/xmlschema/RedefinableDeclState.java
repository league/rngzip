/** state that parses redefinable declaration.
 * 
 * "Declarations" are attribute, element, complexType, group, and attributeGroup.
 * simpleType is treated differently.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When this state is used under states other than RedefineState, this class
 * doesn't do anything. When used under RedefineState, this class does several
 * tricks to make redefinition easy.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Redefinition is done in the following steps.
 * 
 * <h2> Step.1 </h2>
 * <p>
 * First, say redefinition of declaration "ABC" is found, "ABC" has already
 * defined once and it is
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li>referenced from {@link ReferenceContainer} by name, and
 *  <li>referenced from other expressions directly.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <img src="doc-files/redefine1.gif" />
 * 
 * <h2> Step.2 </h2>
 * <p>
 * In startSelf method, this class clones the current definition, and updates
 * ReferenceContainer to point to the cloned definition (right side).
 * 
 * <img src="doc-files/redefine2.gif" />
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that other expressions hold direct reference to the original definition
 * (left side), and these references are not affected by this update.
 * 
 * <h2> Step.3 </h2>
 * <p>
 * Body of redefinition is parsed and corresponding expression is created by
 * derived class. This step is done no differently.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since ReferenceContainer has updated, any reference to this expression found
 * during this step is bound to the cloned definition. This self reference usually
 * happens.
 * 
 * <h2> Step.4 </h2>
 * <p>
 * After the body of redefinition is parsed, the original definition (left side)
 * is updated by using new expression.
 * 
 * <img src="doc-files/redefine3.gif" />
 * 
 * <p>
 * From now on, redefinition becomes visible to all expressions that hold
 * direct reference to the original definition. The cloned definition is kept
 * as-is so that any self reference found in the body will be maintained correctly.
 * 
 * <h2> Step.5 </h2>
 * <p>
 * Finally, ReferenceContainer is updated again to point to the updated definition.
 * Therefore successive reference to "ABC" will be bound to the updated definition.
 * Cloned old definition is kept as-is.
