/**
 * Used to mark a occurrence constraint which cannot
 * be easily represented by primitive expressions.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This expression is just a marker, and the exp field
 * of this instance still contains the precise expression
 * of the occurrence constraint.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, if A is maxOccurs=5 and minOccurs=3,
 * then the exp field of this instance will be:
 * <code>A,A,A,(A,A?)?</code>, the maxOccurs field
 * will be 5, the minOccurs field will be 3, and
 * the itemExp field will hold a reference to <code>A</code>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that MSV doesn't using this marker by itself.
 * It is intended to help other applications that use
 * the AGM of MSV.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Also note that this expression will not
 * be used in the following cases to avoid excessive allocation
 * of this expression:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *  <li>when maxOccurs=unbounded and minOccurs is 1 or 0
 *  <li>when maxOccurs=1
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Those cases can be expressed quite nicely with existing primitives
 * So the client shouldn't find it difficuult to process them.
 * I appreciate any feedback on this issue.
