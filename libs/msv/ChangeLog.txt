From 2001/09/10 version to Nov,2001 version
-------------------------------------------

- RELAX NG DTD compatibility spec is supported.
  
  For details and limitations go to commandline.html.

  MSV is now intended to fully conform to the version 1 spec
  when the "strict schema check" switch is turned on.
  For details of the limitation, see commandline.html


- "JAXP masquerading" feature is implemented
  
  For details, look at JAXPmasquerading.html


- W3C XML Schema support is improved

  Several bugs (handling of attribute wildcards, etc) are fixed.


- "strict" schema check is implemented

  Schema parser now has a switch to perform extra schema checks,
  at the expense of consuming more time to parse a schema.
  Command line tool is updated to accept the "-strict" option
  for this purpose.


- internal representation is modified

  TypedStringExp is splitted into DataExp and ValueExp.
