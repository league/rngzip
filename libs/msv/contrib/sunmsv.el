;; INSTALLATION: change sunmsv-jar-path to point to where you
;; have the msv.jar file; change sunmsv-last-dtd-path to the
;; default DTD (or schema or whatever) file you use most.
;;
;; Call sunmsv-validate to validate your XML file; if you need
;; to provide a path for the java command (ie /usr/jdk/bin/java
;; or something) change the code that creates the 
;; sunmsv-valid-cmd variable.
;;
;; you can use this file, ie (load-library "sunmsv") etc, or
;; copy and paste all this stuff into your .emacs file.
