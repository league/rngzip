A toolbox of utility classes, that may be useful elsewhere.  The
(admittedly vague) criterion for inclusion in this package is that
these classes have little directly to do with the overall application
of type-based XML compression, but are more like a utility layer: data
structures, algorithms, interfaces to other libraries, etc.
